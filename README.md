# Murphy Meal

## Introduction

This is a code sample that I submitted for an interview in September 2021. I have intentionally left out the name of the company that had me complete this coding challenge.

## Provided Instructions

> Please write a native iOS app in Swift using UIKit (no SwiftUI, please) that allows users to browse recipes sorted alphabetically by category using the following API:
> 
> https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
> 
> There are 3 primary endpoints that your app should utilize:
> 1. https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php for fetching the list of categories.
> 2. https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=CATEGORY for fetching the list of meals in a category.
> 3. https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID for fetching the meal details by its ID.
> 
> Categories and meals should be displayed alphabetically with meals sorted into their respective
> categories. How exactly you choose to layout the UI in order to display this information is up to
> you.
> 
> When a user selects a meal, they should be taken to a detail view that includes:
> 
> * Meal name
> * Instructions
> * Ingredients/measurements
> 
> We’re looking for developers, not designers, so don’t get too hung up on how the app looks.
> Instead, focus on how you can leverage system-provided UI elements to display data in a way
> that’s intuitive and user-friendly.
> 
> Please read the following guidelines carefully before starting the coding challenge:
> 
> * Be sure to filter out any null or empty values from the API before displaying them. We encourage you to test out the API first to find where these null or empty values can appear. The API is poorly designed in many respects, and we’re using this as an opportunity to see how you convert imperfectly formatted data into workable models.
> * Loading indicators and error handling are not required, but your submitted code should take both into consideration as future additions necessary for a production ready app.
> * Unit tests are encouraged but not required.
> * Third-party libraries are not allowed.
> * The app should compile using the latest version of Xcode.
> 
> Take as much time as you need to complete this challenge. While your solution does not need to be fully production ready, you are being evaluated, so please put your best foot forward.
